      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using soil moisture sensors?",
      "options": [
        "A. Preventing over-irrigation",
        "B. Detecting plant diseases early",
        "C. Optimizing water usage",
        "D. Increasing seed germination rates"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B. Detecting plant diseases early",
      "description": "Soil moisture sensors are primarily used to optimize irrigation by preventing over- or under-watering, but they do not directly detect plant diseases."

      "question": "What does NDVI stand for and why is it important in precision agriculture?",
      "options": [
        "A. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, it measures plant stress",
        "B. Nutrient Deficiency Vision Indicator, it detects soil nutrient levels",
        "C. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, it indicates vegetation health",
        "D. Nutrient Deficiency Vision Indicator, it measures plant growth"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, it indicates vegetation health",
      "description": "NDVI, or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, is a measure derived from remote sensing that indicates the health and vigor of vegetation by comparing the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and visible light (which vegetation absorbs)."

      "question": "What is the significance of multispectral imaging in plant health monitoring, and how does it differ from traditional imaging?",
      "options": [
        "A. It captures images in multiple spectra to detect plant stress invisible to the naked eye",
        "B. It uses a single spectrum to provide clearer images than traditional cameras",
        "C. It is a cheaper alternative to traditional imaging",
        "D. It provides 3D models of plants for better visualization"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A. It captures images in multiple spectra to detect plant stress invisible to the naked eye",
      "description": "Multispectral imaging captures data at specific frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum, including wavelengths not visible to the naked eye. This allows for the detection of plant stress, disease, and nutrient deficiencies before they are visible to the naked eye, unlike traditional imaging which captures only visible light."
